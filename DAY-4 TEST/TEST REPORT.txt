1.Overall trend: Sales fluctuate rather than grow steadily, indicating daily variability in demand.
2.Mid-October: Sales rise from around Oct 7–8, reaching a local peak around Oct 18–19.
3.Late October: A dip is visible after the mid-month peak, followed by another spike around Oct 31.
4.Early November: Sales peak again around Nov 4, then drop sharply by Nov 6.
5.Pattern insight: The repeated spikes suggest event-driven or promotional sales days, not consistent daily performance.
 Business interpretation Sales are not stable day to day, so forecasting should consider seasonality, campaigns, or weekdays/weekends.
6.High-spike days should be analyzed further to identify: Promotions Product launches Channel or regional drivers
